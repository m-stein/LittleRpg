# LittleRpg

## Brief

This is my first attempt in creating a game with vanilla JavaScript.

## Usage

In order to host and play this game locally, you need to have [npm, npx](https://www.npmjs.com/),
and [vite](https://vitejs.dev) installed. Furthermore, you need to have a browser with support for
Javascript ES6. Here are the vite parameters this project was created with:

* Project name: LittleRpg
* Package name: littlerpg
* Framework: Vanilla
* Variant: JavaScript

This is how you can start hosting the game locally (Windows PowerShell):

> git clone git@github.com:m-stein/LittleRpg.git
> cd .\LittleRpg
> npx vite

Then open the URL that vite listed under "Local" in your browser and enjoy.

Thanks a lot to [Drew Conley](https://www.youtube.com/@DrewConley) and his "RPG Kit" video series
(Build a Game with JavaScript and HTML Canvas) for inspiring and guiding me in the early process of
creating the game.
